The number of students wanting to pursue higher
education abroad is increasing rapidly every year, especially in
the US-based universities, and they find it difficult to find the
best university. And so, this paper helps predict Indian students
eligibility to be admitted in the best university based on the
attributes such as GRE score,TOEFL score,CGPA,research
papers etc. The possibility of their chance of admit is then
calculated using their scores . This project is done using machine
learning techniques namely decision tree, linear regresion and
randomm forest algorithms to predict the output that helps
the students to admit to the best university and also helps the
student find the possibility to admit to other universities based
on their scores. Out of the three algorithms linear regression
showed higher accuracy
